		/* properties of lcm
		 * 1. The L.C.M. of two or more numbers cannot be less than any one of them. For
		 * example,the L.C.M. of 3, 8 and 12 is 24 which is not less than any given
		 * numbers.
		 * 
		 * 2. If a number is the factor of another number, their L.C.M. is the greater
		 * number itself. For example, the L.C.M. of 8 and 16 is the greater number 16
		 * itself.

//		Properties of Square Root
//		1.A perfect square root exists for a perfect square number only.
//		2.The square root of an even perfect square is even.
//		3.An odd perfect square will have an odd square root.
//		4.A perfect square cannot be negative and hence the square root of a negative number is not defined.
//		5.Numbers ending with (having unit’s digit) 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9 will have a square root.
//		6.If the unit digit of a number is 2, 3, 7, or 8 then a perfect square root is not possible.
//		7.If a number ends with an odd number of zeros, then it cannot have a square root. A square root is only possible for even number of zeros.
//		8.Two square roots can be multiplied. √5, when multiplied by √2, gives √10 as a result.
//		9.Two same square roots are multiplied to give a non- square root number. When √25 is multiplied by √25 we get 25 as a result.
